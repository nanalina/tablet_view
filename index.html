                <p>White sauce pasta is a creamy and savory dish that can be enjoyed for either lunch or dinner. Inspired by a fusion of Italian and French cuisine, the rough texture of rigatoni pasta allows for heavier sauces to be picked up, including the flavor profile of this delicious sauce. This union of two cultures allows for the perfect balance between each component of the recipe, creating a fulfilling entree that every individual can enjoy.</p>
